        <p>
          I am a passionate full stack software developer with a wealth of
          experience in backend database design, frontend integration, and cloud
          infrastructure. In my current role, I build digital solutions using
          TypeScript, containerized in Docker, and deployed with Kubernetes. I
          thrive in environments where I can streamline development processes
          with CI/CD pipelines, whether through GitHub Actions or cloud-native
          tools. My expertise spans modern frameworks like Remix.js, Next.js,
          and NestJS, and I regularly work with databases such as PostgreSQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having set up serverless architectures in Kubernetes and AWS, I’m
          adept at using infrastructure-as-code tools like Helm Charts,
          CloudFormation, and managing various cloud services (Lambda, S3,
          DynamoDB). I’ve led technical projects, mentored teams, and
          collaborated on innovation initiatives that utilize cutting-edge
          technology to deliver impactful solutions.
